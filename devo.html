    <h2>The Bread of Life</h2>

    <p>Last week, I was running errands on a hectic Saturday morning. I had skipped breakfast, thinking I’d grab something on the go, but by mid-morning, my stomach was growling so loudly it was impossible to ignore. I realized that when I don’t feed my body, nothing else works as it should. Tasks feel heavier, patience wears thin, and everything becomes a struggle.</p>

    <p>It’s funny how we notice hunger so easily. But there’s another kind of hunger that’s harder to see: spiritual hunger. We can be busy, distracted, or even surrounded by good things, yet still feel empty inside. Jesus calls Himself the true source of satisfaction, the Bread of Life.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty." – John 6:35
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jesus didn’t just come to provide a temporary fix. He’s inviting us into a life where our deepest longings are met. Like physical bread nourishes our bodies, His presence sustains our hearts. When we seek Him, we find a peace, joy, and satisfaction that no worldly pleasure can ever fully supply.</p>

    <p>Think about it: we often try to fill our lives with achievements, social media, relationships, or even comfort food. And while these things are not bad in themselves, they cannot fully satisfy. Only Jesus gives lasting nourishment. Coming to Him daily, through prayer, Scripture, and worship, feeds the part of us that nothing else can.</p>

    <p>Imagine sitting down to a meal after hours of fasting. That first bite fills you, brings comfort, and restores your energy. That’s what happens spiritually when we come to Christ. He meets us in our weariness, our loneliness, and our distractions, offering Himself as the sustenance our souls desperately need.</p>

    <p>When we trust Him, He gives us strength for today and hope for tomorrow. This isn’t a one-time meal — it’s an ongoing provision. The more we feast on Him, the more our lives reflect His love and peace, overflowing into the people around us.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h3>Reflection Question 1</h3>
        <p>Where have you been trying to find satisfaction outside of Christ? How does it compare to the satisfaction Jesus offers?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h3>Reflection Question 2</h3>
        <p>What practical steps can you take this week to “come to the bread” daily? Could it be setting aside quiet time with Scripture, journaling, or talking with a trusted friend about your faith?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="next-step">
        <h3>Next Step</h3>
        <p>Pick one habit this week to feed your soul on Jesus. It could be reading a passage from the Gospel of John each morning, journaling about how He satisfies you, or sharing your reflections with someone else. Make this your spiritual “meal plan” and see how He sustains and strengthens you.</p>
