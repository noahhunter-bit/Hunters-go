    <section style="max-width:850px;margin:1.25rem auto;">
      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Story</h2>
      <p>Hanna and I met at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School in Ellendale, North Dakota. We were both pursuing degrees, Hanna in Elementary Education, me in Global Missions, and both of us in Biblical Studies. What started as friendship on chapel worship teams and late-night conversations about God’s heart for the nations grew into a partnership for life and ministry.</p>
      <p>We got married in May 2025, and it is still surreal to think about. Hanna’s journey started with the Pack Your Bags program in Fall 2022, traveling to the Philippines, Thailand, and Israel, serving on Native American reservations, and experiencing urban poverty in Milwaukee. I joined a year later, Fall 2023, going through similar stateside missions before traveling overseas to the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, and Greece. Those experiences did not just shape our perspective on missions, they shaped us. We learned missions is not just about what we do, but who God is shaping us to become. We are learning that together, one step at a time.</p>
      
      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Calling</h2>
      <p>God has been pursuing our hearts for intercultural missions from a young age. I first felt a clear calling to South Sudan in seventh grade. It was a place I had never been, among a people I did not know, but the burden would not go away. That calling has grown, even through closed doors and postponed plans.</p>
      <p>Hanna has always had a heart for the vulnerable and exploited. Her experiences in school and ministry gave her a real sense of what it means to pursue freedom for people trapped in modern slavery. She believes everyone deserves to know they are seen, valued, and loved by God.</p>
      <p>Our callings intersect naturally. Refugees and the exploited often face similar struggles, trauma, displacement, and survival. God is not calling us to separate missions. He is calling us to a shared vision: bring hope, dignity, and the gospel to people society often overlooks.</p>
      
      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We want to go where God sends us, love the people He loves, and show the good news of Jesus through words and actions. South Sudan is our long-term calling, but we are saying yes to every opportunity He opens along the way, like our upcoming mission to Las Vegas with Operation for Freedom.</p>
      <p>We want to be part of God’s work. Romans 10:14-15 reminds us that someone has to go. That is what we are trying to do. It is not complicated. Small steps, steady faithfulness, living daily in obedience and trust. That is the mission.</p>
      
      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Life and Preparation</h2>
      <p>Right now, we are students at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School, set to graduate in Spring 2027. We are taking every classroom lesson, chapel service, and mentorship seriously, but some of the best preparation has come from real experience. Worship ministry, serving in nearby communities, overseas trips, and Pack Your Bags experiences taught us to stretch, trust, and embrace the unexpected.</p>
      <p>We are learning to hold our plans with open hands. South Sudan is still the goal, but God’s timeline does not always match ours. We are saying yes to the work He gives us now. We want to grow faithfully, steadily, one step at a time, trusting the slow work of becoming, and ready for whatever comes next.</p>
